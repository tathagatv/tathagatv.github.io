Hi, I am Tathagat Verma, doing my MS in Computer Science at Stanford University. I've done my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay, graduated in 2022.

I have been a member of the [InfoLab](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/infolab/) group where I worked with Prof. [Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen) and Prof. [Abir De](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~abir) in collaboration with [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). Our work - VarScene was published at ICML 2022.

I have also worked with Prof. [Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash) on my Thesis project on Medical Image Enhancement.

I have done internships at [Microsoft IDC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc) (Summer 2021), [Coupa Software](https://www.coupa.com/) (Summer 2020) and [Delta Exchange](https://www.delta.exchange/) (Summer 2019).

My interests include applications of machine learning, entrepreneurship, tennis, running and reading books. I maintain a list of books that I read under the [Reading]({{ site.url }}/reading) tab.
