Hi, I am Tathagat Verma, doing my final year BTech in Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). 

I am working with Prof. [Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash) on my Thesis project on Medical Image Enhancement and I am a member of the [InfoLab](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/infolab/) group where I have worked with Prof. [Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen) and Prof. [Abir De](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~abir) in collaboration with [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/).
