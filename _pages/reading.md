I enjoy reading biographies and books related to business and self-development. To the ones who aren't actively reading books, I urge you to start reading!

Below each book title, I've put a short reason for reading the book and the rating I'd give it. I've noticed over time that reading books recommended by people you revere usually turns out to be good.
